This project is a light-weight, simple, yet compatible audio player.

Supports Android 1.0+

It allows you to play audio and video files, like how you expected to. Most importantly it is designed in hope to make it compatible with different Android versions.
Its usage is as easy as opening or sharing the file you want to play with the app, or selecting it directly from the app. Enjoy your music!
Note that this project was originally known as simple music player.

Currently partially support m3u/m3u8 playlist files. More information below in section Playlist Support.

You can find most information about Little Music Player just below.

Different variations

- Tiny Music Player https://github.com/martinmimigames/tiny-music-player
  Smallest, most minimal, with the trade-off of only having the most basic features.


Playlist support

- Temporary playlist via multi-share function
- Partial m3u/m3u8 support

m3u/m3u8 features supported:

- Nested m3u/m3u8 files (Absolute path only)
- Custom audio name via "#EXTINF: [duration], [custom name]" , does not support duration

Features

- It's free
  Everyone should have the right to listen to music, therefore we aim to make it accessible.

- No advertisement
  We simply want a distraction-free experience for you, so you can relax and enjoy!

- Compact
  Less than half a MB in size, one of the tiniest audio player apps on Android! No need to worry about bloated apps again. (Currently less than 30 KB)

- Unbelievably compatible
  Strangely addicted to support, we believe that nobody should be excluded due to an older device. Therefore we have theoretical support starting all the way back from Android 1.0, and tested support on Android 2.3 and above. Isn't it amazing?

- Clean & Simple
  No awkward layout, no hidden options and straightforward, so you can focus on the content. Enjoyment is key, right?

- It simply works :)
  Even in the modern world, there is always something seeming to fail. Luckily for you, this app was designed to work just like it is supposed to. It supports all audio types that your device supports.

- Minimal permissions required
  Have you ever met an app asking for a bunch of unrelated permissions? Have you ever had some strange requests reminding you of a malware? Not this app! We will explain how we use all our permissions, so you know it's safe to use.

- No hidden third-parties
  It is completely open-source, and uses as little third-party libraries as possible.

If you worry about size, compatibility or privacy, this is the best app for you!

We use the foreground service permission to provide audio playing while using other apps.
We use the notification permission for displaying playback control, as we are mainly a notification
based music player.
We use the internet permission to allow for audio streaming, however such function is still being
developed, and can be very buggy.
We use the read storage/audio/video permission to open the audio files. Required for older devices, and m3u/m3u8 processing.

(Beta function)
Share a url containing a media file to Little Music Player to stream it.
Or use a m3u file with the stream url inside.
